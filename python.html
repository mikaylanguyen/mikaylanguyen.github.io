        <h2>1. Describe some programming concepts or structures you learned in this unit that you applied in your story.</h2>
               <h3>One programming concept that I learned from this section of Python Fiction stories is creating a real storyline. I learned how games like 
               POKEMON are able to give the viewer an option and the user is allowed to choose a certain one or input a certain word or letter to go one route. 
               The branches and routes and ending of each portion was also fun and great to explore. One thing that I did not know was every action I wanted my the character to accomplish
               I had to code and define each one. </h3>

        <h2>2. Think back to other stories you read, identify one or two stories you particularly like? Why?</h2>
</h2>           <h3>One of the stories that I enjoyed reading was Leanne and Helen's story. I thought the story they created was creative and funny. 
I liked how one of the ending of the branches was how the character choked on boba. I had to play the story 3 times in order to survive. I also enjoyed Dennis and Emily's story on 
Jail Break. I enjoyed the format of their story and the overall plot of escaping jail. </h3>
