        <p><center><h2>Pacman Remake</h2></center></p>
           <h3>This game is a remake of Toru Iwatani creation of PACMAN. 
           This original game was a classic where the objective was for 
           pacman to do around and collect the white dots while avoiding 
           the ghost! Our remake is similar. However, we included different 
           factors such as music, the brunner heads instead of white dots, 
           difficulty increase with different stages, brunner heads as an attack,
           and more. The objective of our game has the same goal as the original 
           to collect more points as much as possible and avoiding the ghosts.</h3>

               <h2>1. Describe some programming concepts or structures you learned in this unit that you applied in your game.</h2>
               <p>By using scratch, I was able to learn many concepts like the block building in order to make my sprite move. I learned what
               a nested code is different from a topped code. In the game pacman remake, I learned how to code a pre-set location for the sprite to follow.</p>
